This is a reinforcement learning bilateral trade model that is meant to simulate supply and demand. Agents (buyers and sellers) are introduced to an environment with a given, randomly generated, value for a product (let's use donuts in this case!). They pair up with a random buyer, or seller during a specific round and if a successful trade goes through, they are more likely to do the trade again due to the reinforcement learning rule.

# HOW TO INSTALL
Use this in any IDE; this was produced in Jupyter Notebook so that may work best for you.
